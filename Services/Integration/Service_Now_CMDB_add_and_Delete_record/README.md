# Integrate ServiceNow and Infoblox with Cloud Automation Manager using Service Composer

The concepts of Integration templates and Helm charts are introduced in IBM Cloud Automation Manager 2.1.0.2. You can use them in the Service Composer to create services that provide end-to-end utilities.

This sample demonstrates how to build a service that deploys WebSphere Application Server with asset entries that are done on ServiceNow. It also includes APM and ELK configuration. The ELK monitors the logs at run time and APM monitors the performance and availability of your applications to ensure efficient use of resources.
