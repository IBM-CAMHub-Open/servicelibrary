# Highly Available ICP Deployment with klusterlet on Amazon EC2

This [IBM Cloud Automation Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS2L37/product_welcome_cloud_automation_manager.html) service configuration first uses the [AWS provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html) to provision virtual machines on AWS and deploys [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/products/ibm-cloud-private/) 3.2.0 on them. This configuration then imports the deployed ICP to [IBM Multicloud Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/mcm/getting_started/introduction.html) Controller to be managed by the controller.

More details on IBM Cloud Automation Manager Service can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS2L37_3.2.1.0/cam_managing_services.html).

This service is composed of following terraform templates

- [IBM Cloud Private 3.2.0 highly-available cluster in AWS](https://github.com/IBM-CAMHub-Open/template_icp_aws) terraform template.
- [IBM Multicloud Manager 3.2.0](https://github.com/IBM-CAMHub-Open/template_mcm_install/tree/3.2.0/ICP/terraform) terraform template. 


This service can be either deployed from IBM Cloud Automation Manager or from IBM Cloud Private Catalog.

## Deploying the service from IBM Cloud Automation Manager

To deploy this service from IBM Cloud Automation Manager navigate to Library > Services > Cluster Lifecycle Services > ICP cluster on Amazon EC2. Fill the following input parameters and deploy the service.

Note: Bastion Node, Master Node, Proxy Node, Management Node, Worker Node and Vulnerability Advisor Node are hidden parameters. If you need to change them then make a copy of this service configuration and create a new sevice in IBM Cloud Automation Manager with the new configuration.
