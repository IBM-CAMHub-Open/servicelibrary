# OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 cluster on VMware 

## Overview
This service deploys OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster version 3.11 on VMware and imports it into an existing IBM Multi Cloud Manager (MCM) controller.


## Supported topologies
![alt text](./OCP.jpg)

The service contains a decision points which allows customers to chose one of the following two OCP topologies: 
1. [OpenShift Container Platform Single Node Installation](https://github.com/IBM-CAMHub-Open/template_openshift_installer_single/tree/3.11) In this topology, a single node is deployed and all OCP services are deployed on that single node. Refer to the template documentation for more details.


2. [OpenShift Container Platform Enterprise Installation](https://github.com/IBM-CAMHub-Open/template_openshift_installer/tree/3.11)
In this topology, each one of the following services can have its own dedicated node: 
 - master (one or more)
 - lb (optional)
 - etcd (can be combined with the master node if the provided hostname and IP are the same)
 - infra (one)
 - compute (one or more. At least 3 nodes if glusterFS is enabled)
 Refer to the template documentation for more details.

The second activity of the service is [IBM Multicloud Manager Klusterlet on OpenShift](https://github.com/IBM-CAMHub-Open/template_mcm_install/tree/3.2.0/OCP/terraform) It performs a MCM import which will register the newly deployed MCM cluster with an existing MCM controller(hub)
